This repo is intended for any translation efforts for the game. If you want raw text without my processing, I recommend just using [resleriana-db](https://github.com/theBowja/resleriana-db), which is the foundation of this repo. If you want to run `get_dialogue.py` or `masterdata.py`, you are expected to have a local copy somewhere. I thought to have this all download from github, but had a hiccup doing that.

Masterdata is not an exhaustive search for every string in those files, I know I missed some.

I attempted to sort and group the events into fewer files. I do not promise the order is perfect, but I left the source file in one of the columns so you'd never be lost.

TalkEvent is JP only from 22 onward.
