This repo is intended for any translation efforts for the game. When I got more info I'll give more info.

The script I use is jank. I could have been smart and just piggybacked off an existing script, but reading the work of others is scary and I was having fun.

There's something funny about AtelierTalk names, and yes a lot of CityTalkEvent files are broken, as well as a few TalkEvent. I just have txt files where things broke instead of CSV.

Still need to test results more teehee.

idk I'm tired I can work out more details later. work in progress.

TalkEvent is JP only from 20 onward. This will likely change before global EOS.
